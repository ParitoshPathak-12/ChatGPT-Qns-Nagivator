# ChatGPT-Qns-Nagivator Chrome Extension

## The Problem
Do you have the habit of asking lot of questions in a single chat of Chat-GPT?
> Well, whenever I am using ChatGPT to learn a concept, I end up asking a lot of questions in a single chat (obviously to keep the context same, like a conversation) and then sometimes I want to go to my previous questions and answers. But as of now, you need to scroll up and down to find your previous questions and answers right!?

## The Solution
That's where this chrome extension can help you. It gives you option to click on a question number and directly jump to that question in the chat. For ex: If you have 10 questions in the current chat, then you can see the list like: Q1, Q2, Q3... and then click on the question and directly jump to it.
It helps you in a way that you don't need to scroll up and down and you can jump to questions directly and then see the question/answer you want.

## Add More Features
If you are interested in adding more features to it, please do it. Raise it here or fork/clone this repo and try out new features.
> One feature which I want (might work on that later when free), is dragging the button (Questions List button) and allowing the user to place it any where on page based on user's comfort. Currently that button is statically shown on top center of page.
